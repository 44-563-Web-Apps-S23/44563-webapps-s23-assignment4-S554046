        <h4>THE LAST STRAW _Bosworth Crocker_</h4>
        <p>
            SCENE: _The basement of a large apartment-house in New York City._ <br>

            <br> SCENE: _The kitchen of the Bauer flat in the basement of the Bryn
     Mawr. A window at the side gives on an area and shows the walk
     above and the houses across the street. Opposite the windows is a
     door to an inner room. Through the outer door, in the centre of the
     back wall, a dumb-waiter and whistles to tenants can be seen. A
     broken milk-bottle lies in a puddle of milk on the cement floor in
     front of the dumb-waiter. To the right of the outer door, a
     telephone; gas-range on which there are flat-irons heating and
     vegetables cooking. To the left of the outer door is an old
     sideboard; over it hangs a picture of Schiller. Near the centre of
     the room, a little to the right, stands a kitchen table with four
     chairs around it. Ironing-board is placed between the kitchen table
     and the sink, a basket of dampened clothes under it. A large
     calendar on the wall. An alarm-clock on the window-sill. Time: a
     little before noon. The telephone rings_; MRS. BAUER _leaves her
     ironing and goes to answer it_.<br>


     <br>MRS. BAUER. No, Mr. Bauer's out yet. [_She listens through the
    transmitter._] Thank you, Mrs. Mohler. [_Another pause._] I'll tell him
    just so soon he comes in--yes, ma'am.<br>


    <br>[MRS. BAUER _goes back to her ironing. Grocer boy rushes into
     basement, whistling; he puts down his basket, goes up to_ MRS.
     BAUER'S _door and looks in_.<br>


     <br>LANE. Say--where's the boss?<br>

    <br>MRS. BAUER. He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?<br>

    <br> [_He stands looking at her with growing sympathy._<br>

     <br>LANE. Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
    groceries for Sawyers.<br>

    <br>MRS. BAUER. [_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
    which hangs beside the door._] Here.<br>

    <br>LANE. What's the matter?<br>

    <br>MRS. BAUER. [_Dully._] Huh?<br>

    <br>LANE. [_Significantly._] Oh, I know.<br>

    <br>MRS. BAUER. What you know?<br>

    <br>LANE. About the boss. [MRS. BAUER _looks distressed_.] Heard your
    friends across the street talkin'.<br>

    <br>MRS. BAUER. [_Bitterly._] Friends!<br>

    <br>LANE. Rotten trick to play on the boss, all right, puttin' that old maid
    up to get him pinched.<br>

    <br>MRS. BAUER. [_Absently._] Was she an old maid?<br>

    <br>LANE. The cruelty-to-animals woman over there [_waves his
    hand_]--regular old crank. Nies[H] put her up to it all right.<br>

    <br>MRS. BAUER. I guess it was his old woman. Nies ain't so bad. She's the
    one. Because my two boys dress up a little on Sunday, she don't like it.<br>

    <br>LANE. Yes, she's sore because the boys told her the boss kicks their
    dog.<br>

    <br>MRS. BAUER. He don't do nothin' of the sort--jus' drives it 'way from
    the garbage-pails--that's all. We coulda had that dog took up long
    ago--they ain't got no license. But Fritz--he's so easy--he jus' takes
    it out chasin' the dog and hollerin'.<br>

    <br>LANE. That ain't no way. He ought to make the dog holler--good and
    hard--once; then it'd keep out of here.<br>

    <br>MRS. BAUER. Don't you go to talkin' like that 'round my man. Look at all
    this trouble we're in on account of a stray cat.<br>

    <br>LANE. I better get busy. They'll be callin' up the store in a minute.
    That woman's the limit.... Send up the groceries in that slop, she'd
    send them down again. High-toned people like her ought to keep maids.<br>

    <br>[_He mops out the lower shelf of the dumb-waiter, then looks at the
     broken bottle and the puddle of milk inquiringly._<br>
